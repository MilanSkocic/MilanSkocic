  abstract = {Shadow corrosion has long been an issue in BWRs (Boiling Water Reactors): the use of Ni-based grids in close connection to Zry-2 cladding induces locally an accelerated corrosion which can in some instance lead to low remaining metal thickness at the contact point. It is understood since at least 20 years that it is a galvanic coupling phenomenon. However, some important aspects are still debated, due in particular to the fact that it cannot be reproduced without irradiation. Under (neutron) irradiation and at reactor temperature, several parameters are not known accurately (for example the electrical conductivity of the coolant and of the oxide, or the Open Circuit Voltage and current of the metal parts). The role of the contact point between the grid and the cladding is also poorly understood. To improve our understanding, a photoelectrochemical cell, simulating the conditions of Light Water Reactors was designed, developed and validated. Electrochemical methods, performed in-situ, were used to study the electrochemical behavior of Zr-based and Ni-based alloys. Out of pile experiments with or without UV light were performed to measure the OCV (Open Circuit Voltage), the exchange current densities as well as the Tafel slopes (transfer coefficients) of Ni- and Zr-electrodes. The influence of the irradiation flux allowed extrapolations in order to attempt to assess what could happen under neutron irradiation. A finite element modeling based on the Butler-Volmer equation allowed to take simultaneously into account the thermal and galvanic corrosion. Thermal feedback due to the thermal insulating property of the oxide is also included. Parametric studies allowed deriving order of magnitudes of the unknown parameters. To our knowledge, this is currently the most advanced shadow corrosion modeling.},

  abstract = {The electrochemical behavior and the chemical composition of passive films formed on the Alloy 690 at room temperature in borate buffer solution (pH = 9.0) was studied with different techniques for two surface finishings. XPS and quantum yield measurements showed the presence of Ni and Cr oxides and hydroxides for passive films formed on both the as received and the mechanically polished one, whereas the presence of mixed spinel type Ni(1-x)FexCr2O4 was only observed on the as received material. Additionally, Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) highlighted a higher corrosion resistance for the as received alloy in comparison with the mechanically polished alloy, which was linked to the chemical composition of the oxide film. Electrochemical measurements were performed before, during, and after oxidation of the Alloy 690 of Steam Generator (SG) tube of Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) at high temperature and high pressure in the simulated primary circuit of PWR. At high temperature, the interface becomes electrochemically active yielding the precipitation of the corrosion products which form a few tens of nm thick diffusion barrier for the released metal cations. This overlayer is built on the top of a few nm thick, Cr-rich inner-layer at the alloy/oxide interface which was found to behave similarly to that initially formed at ambient temperature. It is concluded that high temperature oxidation in the static condition of an autoclave at 325 \textdegree C does not promote a better passivation state than the one already existing initially.},
